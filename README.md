# Expression To String and Expression Tree Visualizer
This project provides the following:

* [![NuGet Status](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ExpressionTreeToString.svg?style=flat&max-age=86400) ](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExpressionTreeToString/) Extension methods to create a C# or VB.NET code-like string representation, of expression trees or expression tree parts
* A debugging visualizer for expression trees / expression tree parts  
Note: you currently have to compile the visualizer in order to use. The visualizer DLL and dependent DLL (`MultiSelectTreeView.DLL`, both in `\ExpressionTreeVisualizer\ExpressionTreeVisualizer\bin\Debug`) need to be placed in the appropriate folder, as outlined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-install-a-visualizer?view=vs-2017). Eventually there'll be a VSIX package for the visualizer.

## Expression To String
```csharp
Expression<Func<bool>> expr = () => true;

Console.WriteLine(expr.ToString("C#")); 
// prints: () => true

Console.WriteLine(expr.ToString("Visual Basic"));
// prints: Function() True
```

Features:

* Support for outputting both C# and VB.NET
* Extension methods are rendered as instance methods

    ```csharp
    Expression<Func<int, int>> expr = x => Enumerable.Range(1, x).Select(y => x * y).Count();
    Console.WriteLine(expr.ToString("C#"));
    // prints: (int x) => Enumerable.Range(1, x).Select((int y) => x * y).Count()
    ```

* Closed-over variables are rendered as simple identifiers (instead of member access on the hidden compiler-generated class)

    ```csharp
    var i = 7;
    var j = 8;
    Expression<Func<int>> expr = () => i + j;
    Console.WriteLine(expr.ToString("C#"));
    // prints: () => i + j
    ```

Note that support for the full range of types in `System.Linq.Expressions` is incomplete, but [progressing](https://github.com/zspitz/ExpressionToCode/issues/32).

## Expression Tree Visualizer

![Screenshot](screenshot-01.png)

The UI consists of three parts:

1. Tree view of the various parts of an expression tree
2. Source code view, using the above `ExpressionToString` library
3. End nodes -- nodes in the expression tree which are not composed of other expressions

## Visualizer features

* Live switching between C# and VB.NET

* Selection syncing when selecting from the tree:

  and from end nodes:
